## About

This repo contains functions for computing Bayes factors. 

Currently, the following distributions are supported for likelihoods:

- *d* scaled non-central *t*
- *t* scaled non-central *t*
- normal distribution
- binomial distribution
- scaled and shifted t distribution 

The following distributions are supported for priors:

- Cauchy distribution (with arbitrary location parameter)
- normal distribution
- beta distribution
- uniform
- scaled and shifted t-distribution
- point
